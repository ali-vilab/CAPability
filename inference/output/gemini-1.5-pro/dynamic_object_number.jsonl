Three pillows are arranged on the sofa: the leftmost is a patterned, silvery-grey, the center pillow is teal, and the rightmost is golden yellow. The camera pans across the room to reveal a bay window with light gray drapes and matching cornice. The curtains frame a view of a green lawn with trees and shrubbery. In front of the window sit two small, patterned chairs and a circular, glass-topped table. The camera pans left to show a fireplace flanked by a white media console, a large, framed mirror, and two matching lamps. The media console holds a large flat-screen TV.  A potted green plant sits in front of the fireplace hearth. As the camera continues to pan left across the room, it reveals two more doorways, each with white paneled doors and decorative hardware.  A second light gray sofa is visible, facing the fireplace.  It is accompanied by a large rectangular glass coffee table. The walls of the room are painted a mottled gray and white color, and the ceiling has recessed panels outlined with white molding. The camera makes its way across the room to the fireplace again and gives the viewer a closer look at the white entertainment cabinet.  Finally, the camera reverses its initial path through the room, moving past the sofa, the bay window and its accompanying chairs, and exits back into the hall, showcasing once more the flooring transition. The video is filmed in a realistic style, providing a clear and detailed view of the living room's interior design. No text is present."}

A smaller, patterned rug in shades of maroon and cream lies in front of a stone fireplace which forms a focal point of the room. The fireplace has a black wood-burning stove within it, a hanging wreath of twigs and feathers above, and a small decorative figurine of a dog on the hearth. Several pieces of light oak furniture are arranged in the room: two loveseats, a three-seater sofa, a TV stand housing a Panasonic television, a small end table, and a tall display cabinet with glass doors. The loveseats are positioned to face the fireplace and TV, while the sofa sits along the wall with patterned blue and green cushions. Some clothing is draped over the sofa's back. The TV stand is situated in the corner of the room by the fireplace. The walls are painted a light beige color, while the curtains framing a large window and glass sliding door leading to a stone patio are a light gold color with a dark red floral pattern. Numerous yellow sticky notes are stuck to the front of the display cabinet. A simple black-framed clock hangs above an end table. The entire room is well-lit, likely by natural light streaming in through the windows, casting shadows of the furniture and chandelier. The camera moves fluidly throughout the room, panning across the space and tilting up and down to capture different angles.

Some of the writing appears to be mathematical equations and programming code. Next to the first whiteboard is a second whiteboard with similar writings. Two office chairs are positioned in front of the whiteboard - one is gray and the other black with a mesh back and metal armrests. \n\nThe camera sweeps across the room to a dark gray L-shaped couch nestled in a corner by a window. Two colorful pillows rest on one end, and a black backpack sits on the other. A rolled-up red mat leans against the wall nearby. \n\nNext, the camera pans to a large wooden desk cluttered with items: two computer monitors (one large and one smaller laptop), a keyboard, a mouse, a racing wheel controller, a glass, some papers, a tennis ball, and some leftover food containers. A black office chair is tucked under the desk. The wall behind the desk has another whiteboard and a poster composed of many smaller pictures.\n\nThe camera quickly circles the room again, revisiting the bookshelf, whiteboards, chairs, and desk, before settling briefly on the computers on the desk. The rapid movement makes it difficult to focus on the details on the screens or the writing on the whiteboard.

Two pillows sport a dark blue geometric pattern with lighter gold accents, complemented by a smaller gray textured pillow. Two matching nightstands, white with light oak tops, flank the bed. Each nightstand holds a crystal-based lamp with a cream-colored shade. \n\n\nThe camera pans to show two windows, dressed with gray drapes that have a dark navy bottom section, and matching Roman blinds with the same geometric pattern as the throw pillows. A white radiator sits beneath the windows. In another corner of the room, a cream-colored armchair with light wooden arms and legs rests against the navy blue wall, accented by a dark navy pillow. A white wardrobe with a mirrored center door stands nearby, a black garment hanging partially out of one side. A white dresser with crystal knobs supports a television and is accompanied by a tall, square white wicker laundry basket with a tan lid. A small wicker waste basket sits next to the dresser.\n\n\nThroughout the tour, a person in a black shirt, dark trousers, and blue shoe covers is occasionally seen reflected in mirrors, appearing to tidy or adjust items. There is no dialogue or music, and the focus remains on the visual details of the room. The video concludes with the camera positioned back by the bed and nightstand, showing the items on it and the dark navy feature wall."}

It begins with a still shot of a printed movie poster for Charlie Chaplin's *Modern Times*, resting on the beige carpeted floor of a hallway. The poster depicts Charlie Chaplin carrying large cogwheels on his shoulders, with \"Charlie CHAPLIN\" above in white letters and \"MODERN TIMES\" below in dark red letters. The poster is printed on a white sheet of paper larger than the poster. The camera pans right, then tilts up to show the bedroom door, which is open and held open by a rectangular wooden door stop on the floor. The door is made of light-colored wood with a gold handle. The camera pans right again to view the bedroom. The room contains two single beds with white, slatted headboards and pale gray floral duvet covers, a light blue throw on one of the beds, and a matching pale gray bed skirt. The carpet matches the beige carpet in the hallway. Between the two beds is a light wood three-drawer nightstand with a cream-colored table lamp, a remote control, and an Amazon Echo Dot sitting on it. A framed picture hangs on the wall above the nightstand. Against the far wall is a light wood dresser with several drawers, a mirror, reed diffusers, and a digital clock on top. A television is mounted on the wall above the dresser. Next to the dresser in the corner of the room is a blue beanbag chair. On the opposite wall is a large built-in wardrobe with six wooden doors, two pairs of which have small white fabric bags hanging from the door handles. The two wooden doors near the bedroom door are slightly ajar and the camera pans left to look through the doors at the poster outside. The camera moves in a steady manner, panning left, right, up, and down to show the different elements of the room. The video is realistic and filmed in a simple point-of-view style.  On the wall next to the wardrobe is a large bay window with cream-colored curtains, under which is a radiator. Beneath the bay window is a matching light wood vanity with a padded seat and a three-way mirror. A hair dryer and hair straightener rest on the vanity surface. The video ends with a close-up of the poster back in the hallway."}
