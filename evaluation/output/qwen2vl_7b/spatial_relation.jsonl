{"spatial_relation": "The bus is under the light", "score": 1, "reason": "The caption mentions 'The lighting fixtures are mounted on the ceiling, casting a bright light onto the bus...' which correctly implies that the bus is under the light, given that the light is being cast onto it.", "file_id": "spatial_relation_542"}
{"spatial_relation": "The path is in front of the building", "score": 0, "reason": "The caption does not specifically mention a path in the spatial relationship with the building, it only mentions a grassy area with people walking around which does not confirm the presence of a path.", "file_id": "spatial_relation_415"}
{"spatial_relation": "The person in the green jacket is in front of the crowd", "score": 1, "reason": "The caption accurately describes the spatial relationship. It mentions two individuals snowboarding with one person in a green jacket, who we can infer is in front of the crowd, as the crowd is described as being in the background watching the event.", "file_id": "spatial_relation_393"}
{"spatial_relation": "The tie is on the basin", "score": -1, "reason": "The caption describes the tie as being loosely tied around the child's neck, not on the basin.", "file_id": "spatial_relation_508"}
{"spatial_relation": "The man is skateboarding on the ramp", "score": -1, "reason": "The caption describes the skateboarder performing a trick on a concrete ledge, not on a ramp.", "file_id": "spatial_relation_958"}
{"spatial_relation": "The door is in the wall", "score": 1, "reason": "The caption correctly indicates the presence of a door with its frame, which implies that the door is part of the wall.", "file_id": "spatial_relation_577"}
{"spatial_relation": "The sign is above the awning", "score": 1, "reason": "The caption correctly states that the prominent sign is above the entrance, which implies that it is positioned over the awning of the ground floor mentioned.", "file_id": "spatial_relation_232"}
{"spatial_relation": "The grass is behind the sign", "score": 1, "reason": "The caption correctly states that the sign is positioned on a paved walkway, surrounded by well-maintained green grass, implying that the grass is indeed behind the sign in the spatial arrangement.", "file_id": "spatial_relation_368"}
{"spatial_relation": "The man is on the snowboard", "score": 1, "reason": "The caption accurately mentions 'a person standing on a snowboard' which aligns with the provided spatial relationship.", "file_id": "spatial_relation_910"}
{"spatial_relation": "The remote is on the table", "score": 0, "reason": "The caption does not mention a remote or its spatial relationship to other objects on the table.", "file_id": "spatial_relation_723"}
{"spatial_relation": "The statue is on the building", "score": 1, "reason": "The caption correctly describes the spatial relationship by stating that there are three large, metallic sculptures of animals which appear to be in motion, and they are mounted on a metal platform that extends from the building's facade. This indicates that the sculptures (statues) are indeed placed on the building, consistent with the provided spatial relationship.", "file_id": "spatial_relation_588"}
{"spatial_relation": "The mirror is near the faucet", "score": 1, "reason": "The caption correctly describes that there is a large mirror above the sink, which implies that it is near the faucet, as typically a sink will have a faucet and the mirror is positioned above it in a bathroom vanity setting.", "file_id": "spatial_relation_968"}
{"spatial_relation": "The photo is in front of the curtain", "score": -1, "reason": "The caption describes a man standing in front of the green curtain, not a photo. It mentions a poster or photograph of a building which is stated to be behind the man, implying that the poster or photograph is on the wall behind the man and thus not in front of the curtain.", "file_id": "spatial_relation_662"}
{"spatial_relation": "The sky is above the fence", "score": 1, "reason": "The image caption implies the presence of a clear sky in the background, which would be positioned above the fence in a typical rural or countryside setting. Although the caption does not explicitly state the sky's position relative to the fence, the description of the clear sky and the setting inherently suggests that the sky is above the fence.", "file_id": "spatial_relation_668"}
{"spatial_relation": "The hook is above the sink", "score": 0, "reason": "The caption does not mention a hook; it describes a metal towel ring to the right of the sink, but there is no information on something being above the sink.", "file_id": "spatial_relation_613"}
{"spatial_relation": "The trees are in front of the tall building", "score": 1, "reason": "The caption correctly describes the trees as being in the foreground with the skyscraper in the background, indicating that the trees are in front of the tall building.", "file_id": "spatial_relation_360"}
{"spatial_relation": "The grass is on the gravel", "score": 0, "reason": "The caption does not mention the spatial relationship between the grass and gravel.", "file_id": "spatial_relation_651"}
{"spatial_relation": "The fence is in front of the plant", "score": 0, "reason": "The caption does not mention the spatial relationship between the fence and the plant.", "file_id": "spatial_relation_698"}
{"spatial_relation": "The basket is on the floor", "score": 0, "reason": "The caption does not mention a basket; it refers to a white trash can on the floor which may or may not be the same object as the basket mentioned in the spatial relationship. Additionally, there is no clear delineation of the objects' relationships using the term 'basket'.", "file_id": "spatial_relation_756"}
