{"pred": ["level angle"], "reason": "The caption explicitly mentions that the camera angle is a medium shot, which suggests a level camera angle as it does not specify shooting from above or below the subject, nor does it mention a tilted horizon that would indicate a dutch angle.", "file_id": "camera_angle_871"}
