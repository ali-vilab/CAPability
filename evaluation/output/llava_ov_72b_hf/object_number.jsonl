{"object_number": "{sushi: 11}", "score": 1, "reason": "The caption mentions two pieces of salmon nigiri sushi, a roll with a green outer layer, a roll with a dark outer layer, a roll with an orange outer layer, and two pieces of sushi rolls with a white outer layer. Since the caption describes 'a roll' as a singular object three times, we can assume each 'a roll' refers to one piece. Therefore, when counted, there are 2 (salmon nigiri) + 1 (green roll) + 1 (dark roll) + 1 (orange roll) + 2 (sushi rolls with white outer layer), which add up to 7 pieces of sushi. The caption does not explicitly state how many individual sushi pieces are within each named 'roll'—for instance, typical sushi rolls are cut into multiple pieces, usually 6 to 8 per roll. If we conservatively estimate each 'roll' to be 6 pieces, and adding the individual pieces mentioned, that would bring the number to 19 (2 salmon nigiri + 6 [green roll] + 6 [dark roll] + 6 [orange roll] + 2 [white roll]). Because there's ambiguity in what each 'roll' counts as and since the reference to the number of pieces within the rolls is missing, it's not possible to definitively confirm or refute the precision of the provided number of 11. However, given the typical assumption of multiple pieces per 'roll', the estimate would exceed the provided number of 11, suggesting a potential discrepancy, but without further clarity, this cannot be confirmed.", "file_id": "object_number_865"}
