{"spatial_relation": "The building with the clock tower is behind the Dusit Thani building", "score": -1, "reason": "The caption describes the building with the clock face as being to the right of the Dusit Thani, not behind it.", "file_id": "spatial_relation_328"}
{"spatial_relation": "The snake is on top of the rock", "score": 1, "reason": "The caption correctly describes the spatial relationship by mentioning that the snake is 'draped over' the rock, which supports the provided relationship that the snake is on top of the rock.", "file_id": "spatial_relation_217"}
{"spatial_relation": "The hand is holding the paper", "score": 1, "reason": "The caption correctly describes that a portion of a person's hand is visible at the bottom left, holding the hot dog and napkin, which implies that the hand is holding the paper napkin.", "file_id": "spatial_relation_569"}
{"spatial_relation": "The blue sign is above the road", "score": 1, "reason": "The caption mentions the 'Allianz' logo and symbol in blue at the top of the Allianz Tower, which is described as being located to the left of the Generali Tower. Since the Allianz Tower is adjacent to the road and the logo is at the top of this building, it is implied that the blue sign is above the level of the road, which is consistent with the provided spatial relationship.", "file_id": "spatial_relation_240"}
{"spatial_relation": "The cyclist is to the right of the bus", "score": -1, "reason": "The caption describes the cyclist as passing in front of the white minivan with the advertising kiosk behind and to the left of the cyclist, which implies the bus (partially obscured by the kiosk) would also be to the cyclist's left, not to the right as stated in the spatial relationship provided.", "file_id": "spatial_relation_164"}
{"spatial_relation": "The dog is sitting in a chair and putting its pows on the table", "score": 1, "reason": "The caption correctly describes the spatial relationship. It mentions that the dog's front paws rest on the wooden surface of the table and that a dark purple velvety fabric, likely part of a chair back, extends from behind the dog, suggesting that the dog is sitting in a chair.", "file_id": "spatial_relation_961"}
{"spatial_relation": "The red and yellow sign is above the poster", "score": 1, "reason": "The caption correctly describes the spatial relationship. It mentions 'Parts of another poster or sticker are visible at the very top of the image, showing red and yellow with a partially obscured word, likely 'PARIS.'', which indicates that the red and yellow sign is indeed above the political poster.", "file_id": "spatial_relation_209"}
{"spatial_relation": "The man is on the playingfield", "score": 1, "reason": "The image caption describes the scene on a baseball field, mentioning a batter in a batter's box, a catcher crouching to receive a pitch, and an umpire positioned directly behind the catcher, which confirms the spatial relationship that the man (a New York Yankees batter, in this case) is indeed on the playing field.", "file_id": "spatial_relation_811"}
{"spatial_relation": "The cross above the bell tower", "score": 1, "reason": "The caption correctly describes the spatial relationship by stating that 'Atop the clock section, a cross sits perched on what appears to be a small dome.' which indicates the cross is positioned above the bell tower.", "file_id": "spatial_relation_255"}
{"spatial_relation": "The building with the red roof is in front of the bridge", "score": 1, "reason": "The caption correctly describes the building with a terracotta-colored tiled roof, which can be assumed to be red, as being in the foreground which would place it in front of the bridge that spans the river in the middle ground.", "file_id": "spatial_relation_60"}
{"spatial_relation": "The person is above the sea", "score": -1, "reason": "The caption describes the young man as being in mid-air while diving to catch a frisbee on a sunny beach, with his shadow cast on the sandy beach. There is no indication in the caption that he is directly above the sea. Instead, the description implies that he is above the beach, not the water.", "file_id": "spatial_relation_600"}
{"spatial_relation": "The playingfield is beneath the fence", "score": 1, "reason": "The caption mentions that a wooden fence separates the playing field from a further background area, which correctly implies that the playing field is beneath the fence spatially.", "file_id": "spatial_relation_772"}
{"spatial_relation": "The mam is surfing on a surfboard", "score": 1, "reason": "The caption accurately describes the spatial relationship by stating that the surfer ('a silhouetted figure in dark attire, possibly a wetsuit') is riding a small wave and that the surfboard is 'appearing as a thin, dark line beneath the surfer,' which indicates the man is on the surfboard.", "file_id": "spatial_relation_696"}
{"spatial_relation": "The skis are near the ski polo", "score": 1, "reason": "The caption describes the skier 'propels himself forward with ski poles' which implies that the ski poles (which might have been mistakenly referred to as 'ski polo') are indeed near the skis as part of the normal action of skiing.", "file_id": "spatial_relation_845"}
{"spatial_relation": "The sky is above the airplane", "score": 1, "reason": "The caption correctly assumes the typical spatial relationship where the sky is positioned above airplanes, as is the case with any image that includes both an airplane on the ground and the sky. Although the caption does not explicitly use the word 'above', it describes the background featuring a partly cloudy sky and mentions the airplane separately, which implicates that the sky is above the airplane.", "file_id": "spatial_relation_658"}
