{"pred": ["low angle"], "reason": "The caption explicitly mentions that the camera angle is 'slightly below the plane of the bench seat,' which classifies it as a 'low angle' shot.", "file_id": "camera_angle_863"}
{"pred": ["low angle", "dutch angle"], "reason": "The caption specifies that the camera angle is a low angle shot, which means the camera is shooting from below the subject. It also mentions a slight tilt, which is indicative of a dutch angle where the camera is tilted from its normal horizontal or vertical position.", "file_id": "camera_angle_786"}
{"pred": ["low angle", "dutch angle"], "reason": "The caption explicitly mentions a 'low, almost worm's-eye view,' indicating a low angle shot, and also describes the camera as 'tilting upwards towards the sky,' which implies a dutch angle due to the tilt.", "file_id": "camera_angle_881"}
{"pred": ["low angle", "dutch angle"], "reason": "The caption explicitly mentions that the camera is positioned at a low angle, and it's slightly canted to the right, which describes a dutch angle.", "file_id": "camera_angle_763"}

{"pred": ["high angle", "dutch angle"], "reason": "The caption states that the camera angle is oblique, positioned somewhere between a level and high angle, and since it is not level, it qualifies as a high angle.
