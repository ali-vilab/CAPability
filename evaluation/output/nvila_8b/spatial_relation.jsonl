{"spatial_relation": "The man is surfing on the sea", "score": 1, "reason": "The caption correctly describes the spatial relationship with the phrase 'a surfer riding a large wave' and provides additional context such as the position of the surfer on the surfboard and the condition of the sea.", "file_id": "spatial_relation_687"}
{"spatial_relation": "The rocks are below the piano", "score": 0, "reason": "The caption does not mention a piano, and therefore does not describe the spatial relationship between rocks and a piano.", "file_id": "spatial_relation_274"}
{"spatial_relation": "The tree is next to the pavement", "score": 1, "reason": "The caption states the bus is parked next to a tree and a sidewalk, which implies that the tree is next to the pavement, as sidewalks run parallel to pavements.", "file_id": "spatial_relation_927"}
{"spatial_relation": "The cat is lying near the wall", "score": 0, "reason": "The image caption does not mention the cat's proximity to the wall or describe the spatial relationship between the cat and the wall.", "file_id": "spatial_relation_935"}
{"spatial_relation": "The tallest building is in front of the construction site", "score": 1, "reason": "The caption correctly describes the spatial relationship by mentioning that there is a construction site with a yellow crane in the background, which implies that the modern high-rise building (presumably the tallest one mentioned) is in front of it.", "file_id": "spatial_relation_445"}
{"spatial_relation": "The people are to the left of the cars", "score": 0, "reason": "The caption does not mention the spatial relationship between the people and the cars.", "file_id": "spatial_relation_50"}
{"spatial_relation": "The stools are in front of the counter", "score": 1, "reason": "The image caption correctly describes the spatial relationship by stating 'where several people are seated on white barstools'. This implies that the stools are in front of the counter where individuals would typically be seated.", "file_id": "spatial_relation_372"}
{"spatial_relation": "The surfboard is on the sea", "score": 1, "reason": "The caption correctly describes both surfers riding on long, light-colored surfboards that are partially submerged in the water, which agrees with the spatial relationship provided.", "file_id": "spatial_relation_855"}
{"spatial_relation": "The bus is parked in the parking space", "score": 1, "reason": "The image caption mentions that the bus is 'parked in a lot,' which correctly implies the spatial relationship that the bus is in a parking space.", "file_id": "spatial_relation_748"}

{"spatial_relation": "The man is standing on the sand", "score": -1, "reason": "The caption describes the person as standing on a frozen body of water, with mentions of ice and snow, which contradicts the provided spatial relationship of the man standing on the sand.", "file_id": "spatial_relation_647"}
{"spatial_relation": "The basketball player image is to the right of the red and blue shoe display", "score": 0, "reason": "The caption does not mention a red and blue shoe display, it describes a large blue poster with a red graphic element instead, and there is not enough information to confirm if this poster is related to or represents a shoe display", "file_id": "spatial_relation_62"}

{"spatial_relation": "The tie is near the banana", "score": 1, "reason": "The caption mentions that the man is holding the banana in his right hand and he is also dressed in a dark suit with a white shirt and a blue tie. Given the position of the hand (holding the banana) is typically at or near the chest or waist level, and the tie would also be at the chest level as part of the shirt, the spatial relationship of the tie being near the banana is implied and correctly described in the caption even though it is not explicitly stated.", "file_id": "spatial_relation_852"}
{"spatial_relation": "The green umbrella is above the red building", "score": 0, "reason": "The caption does not mention a green umbrella or its spatial relationship to the red building.", "file_id": "spatial_relation_199"}
{"spatial_relation": "The bottle is near the plate", "score": 1, "reason": "The caption correctly describes the spatial relationship by stating that the bottle is positioned slightly to the left of the pizza, which implies that the bottle is near the plate that the pizza is on.", "file_id": "spatial_relation_625"}
{"spatial_relation": "The man is standing on the snow", "score": 1, "reason": "The caption accurately describes the man as 'standing on a snowy mountain slope' which implies that he is standing on the snow, matching the provided spatial relationship.", "file_id": "spatial_relation_953"}

{"spatial_relation": "The bumper is below the emblem", "score": 1, "reason": "The image caption correctly describes the spatial relationship between the bumper and the emblem. It mentions that the front bumper features a black grille with a silver emblem in the middle, which implies the emblem is positioned above the bumper, in line with the provided spatial relationship.", "file_id": "spatial_relation_229"}
{"spatial_relation": "The table is on the leaf", "score": 0, "reason": "The caption does not mention the provided spatial relationship between the table and the leaf.", "file_id": "spatial_relation_844"}
{"spatial_relation": "The ship is on the left side of the road", "score": -1, "reason": "The caption describes the larger boat, possibly a cargo ship, as moving towards the right bank, not mentioning its position relative to a road, and certainly not placing it on the left side of the road. Instead, the boat is located in the river. Additionally, the term 'road' is incongruent in the context of the scene described, which centers on a riverbank rather than a roadside setting.", "file_id": "spatial_relation_172"}
{"spatial_relation": "The text 'Dortmund 2018' is below the angel", "score": 1, "reason": "The caption correctly indicates that the sign reading 'Dortmund 2018' is at the base of the tree, which implies it is below the golden angel figure at the top of the tree, accurately describing the spatial relationship.", "file_id": "spatial_relation_202"}
{"spatial_relation": "The plants are front of the hill", "score": 1, "reason": "The image caption mentions that beyond the horse, which is lying in the foreground on the grassy field, the landscape unfolds into rolling hills and fields with patches of grass and trees, suggesting that plants (grass, trees) are indeed in front of the hill, thus correctly describing the spatial relationship.", "file_id": "spatial_relation_858"}
{"spatial_relation": "The paper is on the bench", "score": 1, "reason": "The caption correctly states that the blue piece of paper is on the left side of the bench, which is consistent with 'The paper is on the bench'.", "file_id": "spatial_relation_637"}
