It mentions a bay window with a green trim and a white frame, a single, smaller rectangular window above the bay window for the central house, and a white-framed window for the house to the right. This accounts for three windows. While it also mentions a dark gray arched doorway and no other windows, we can infer that there is a window on the left house, which is similar to the one on the right, as terraced houses usually have a symmetrical design. Therefore, the presence of a fourth window is implied, leading to a total count of four windows.", "file_id": "object_number_278"}
