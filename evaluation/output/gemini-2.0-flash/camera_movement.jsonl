{"pred": ["fixed", "in"], "reason": "The camera is described as having the perspective of someone standing just outside the doorway (indicating a fixed position), focusing on the man entering the kitchen. As the man steps through the doorway, the camera follows him which suggests the camera is moving in closer to the subject.", "file_id": "camera_movement_275"}

{"pred": ["fixed"], "reason": "The caption explicitly states that 'The camera remains static, providing a fixed perspective of the scene as it unfolds.' which falls under the 'fixed' category as the camera does not change its position or angle.", "file_id": "camera_movement_880"}

{"pred": ["fixed"], "reason": "The caption explicitly mentions that throughout the scene, the camera maintains a static position, indicating that there are no movements such as panning, tilting, tracking, dollying or zooming, hence the camera movement can be classified as 'fixed'.", "file_id": "camera_movement_398"}

{"pred": ["fixed"], "reason": "The caption mentions that the camera tracks the man in armor as he moves, which implies that while the subject moves slightly, the camera remains with a fixed focus on him without explicit indication of moving left, right, up, down, in, or out.", "file_id": "camera_movement_147"}

{"pred": ["fixed"], "reason": "The camera is described as being positioned at a low angle, looking up at the people, and seems to be tracking them as they move. However, there is no specific mention of the camera moving 'left', 'right', 'up', 'down', 'in', or 'out'. The term 'tracking' could imply movement, but without a clear direction, we cannot categorize it under 'left', 'right', 'up', 'down', 'in', or 'out'. Therefore, it seems most appropriate to classify the movement as 'fixed' since the camera remains steady in its position relative to the scene.", "file_id": "camera_movement_416"}
