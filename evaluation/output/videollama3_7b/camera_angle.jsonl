{"pred": ["low angle", "dutch angle"], "reason": "The caption indicates that the camera angle is 'slightly tilted upwards' which suggests this is a 'low angle' shot, capturing the scene from below and emphasizing the verticality of the buildings. It also says the angle provides a perspective 'looking down the narrow street,' which adds to the classification as a 'low angle'. Additionally, the use of the word 'tilted' suggests that the camera angle might not be completely level, which aligns with the definition of a 'dutch angle' where the camera is tilted to make the horizon appear crooked.", "file_id": "camera_angle_49"}

{"pred": ["dutch angle"], "reason": "The caption explicitly mentions that the camera angle is slightly tilted, creating a sense of tension or unease.
